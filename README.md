The Magento 2 withdrawal button your EU storefront needs before the 19 June 2026 deadline — a storefront-ready, guided flow (find order → select items → review & confirm) with durable-medium receipt emails and Annex I content in 22 EU locales, on Luma, Hyvä, and Breeze.

It adds only the legal withdrawal step required under Art. 11a, and works alongside your existing RMA / refund process rather than replacing it.

## What it does

- **Storefront withdrawal flow** — guided form (find order → select items → review & confirm) for guests and registered customers at `/withdraw-contract/`
- **Annex I in 22 EU locales** — verbatim EUR-Lex translations where available, theme-overridable per locale
- **Durable-medium receipt** — confirmation email with a frozen snapshot of the legal text shown to the consumer
- **Admin grid and workflow** — filterable request list, mass actions, status state machine, CSV export
- **Article 16 exclusions** — preset list configurable per category, with merchant override

## Install

```bash
composer require mageme/module-eu-withdrawal
bin/magento module:enable MageMe_EUWithdrawal
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento cache:flush
```

After installation, enable the module at **Stores → Configuration → MageMe Extensions → EU Withdrawal**.

→ **[Full installation guide and configuration reference](https://docs.mageme.com/eu-withdrawal/install)**

On **Luma** and **Breeze** (Swissup) storefronts the base module works out of the box — no extra package required. Only **Hyvä** themes need the companion module below.

### Hyvä storefront

If your storefront runs on a Hyvä theme, install the theme companion alongside this module — it ports the
customer-facing withdrawal flow and order-view integrations to Tailwind + Alpine.js:

```bash
composer require mageme/module-eu-withdrawal-hyva
bin/magento module:enable Hyva_MageMeEUWithdrawal
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

If you also run **Hyvä Checkout**, add the checkout companion as well — it re-implements the pre-contract Annex I block
and the digital-content waiver step (Art. 16(m)) for Hyvä Checkout's Magewire runtime:

```bash
composer require mageme/module-eu-withdrawal-hyva-checkout
bin/magento module:enable Hyva_MageMeEUWithdrawalCheckout
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

→ **[Hyvä theme companion](https://github.com/mageme/module-eu-withdrawal-hyva)** · **[Hyvä Checkout companion](https://github.com/mageme/module-eu-withdrawal-hyva-checkout)**

## Requirements

- **Magento 2.4.4 – 2.4.9** (Open Source / Commerce)
- **PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, or 8.5** — match your Magento version's PHP support matrix
- MySQL 8.0+ / MariaDB 10.6+

## Legal disclaimer

This module is provided **AS-IS, without warranty**. It is a **technical implementation** of the workflow described in
[Article 11a of Directive 2011/83/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2011/83/oj); it is **not legal advice** and has
not been reviewed by EU consumer-law counsel.

The merchant is solely responsible for verifying that this implementation satisfies their jurisdiction's specific
consumer-protection requirements, reviewing bundled translations for accuracy in their target markets, and adapting
Article 16 exclusion presets to their actual catalogue.

### Streaming and SaaS subscriptions — out of scope

This module's Art. 16(m) waiver flow is for **one-time digital content** — extensions, ebooks, courses, software
licences, downloadable templates. It is **not** for ongoing **digital services** (streaming, SaaS subscriptions),
where the waiver may not remove the withdrawal right — a digital-content vs digital-service distinction now before the
CJEU in [Case C-234/25](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-234/25). For subscription cancellations and
pro-rata refunds, use your billing platform's own cancellation flow.

→ **[Full disclaimer and merchant compliance checklist](https://docs.mageme.com)**

### Digital-content waiver on API / headless orders

The Art. 16(m) waiver record is created only from a genuine storefront
confirmation (the customer ticking both consent boxes). By default, digital-content orders placed through the
REST/GraphQL API are **blocked** unless a genuine consent record exists for each digital item (the same protection
the storefront enforces). If your headless integration collects the consent itself, record it through the
waiver-event mechanism and the order will pass; or set **Stores → Configuration → MageMe Extensions →
EU Withdrawal → Digital Waiver → Enforce Waiver on API / Headless Orders** to **No** to opt out of API enforcement
(the storefront waiver step is unaffected either way).
